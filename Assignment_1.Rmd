When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
#The below dataset I've used is a  built-in dataset
```{r}
data("mtcars")
summary(mtcars)
```
#To get descriptive statistics for the variables in a dataset
#To transform variable mpg in the dataset, we are multiplying it by 1.4
```{r}
mpg<-mtcars$mpg*1.4
summary(mtcars)
```
#Plotting the variables mpg and hp in the dataset
```{r}
plot(mtcars$mpg,mtcars$hp)
```
#To scatterplot, we use ggplot package.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(mtcars) +
 aes(x = mpg, y = hp) +
 geom_area() +
 theme_minimal()

```
```{r}

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(mtcars) +
 aes(x = gear, y = wt) +
 geom_line(colour = "#112446") +
 theme_minimal()

```
